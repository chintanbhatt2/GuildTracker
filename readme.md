# Automatic Lost Ark Guild Dues Tracker

#### About

I wanted a good way to keep track of who's been keep up to date on donating to my guild in lost ark so I wrote this script in order to keep logs. It also provides a great way of collecting data on how much the guild is projected to earn or if people should be dropped based on activity.


#### How to use

Clone the repository and install all the required libraries included in the files. After that, take a screenshot of your guild's donation history and copy it to your clipboard. Once you run the script it will scan your clipboard and then use that information to store all the values in a SQLite databse.
